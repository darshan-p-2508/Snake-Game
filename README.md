# Snake-Game
We all remember the classic Nokia snake game which we have played at least once in our life time. This is a project that I have tried to recreate using java.
<br>You can find the source code for the snake game in this repository. currently the game is of basic level i.e., the game consists of single level and it displays the score and has and option to restart the game.
<br>I appreciate anyone who would like to contribute to this project in taking it to next level.
<br>Feel free to ask for pull request to contribute.
